## Tips

1. CS3217's Gitbook is at https://www.gitbook.com/book/cs3217/problem-sets/details. Do visit the Gitbook often, as it contains all things relevant to CS3217. You can also ask questions related to CS3217 there.
2. Take a look at `.gitignore`. It contains rules that ignores the changes in certain files when committing an Xcode project to revision control. (This is taken from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Swift.gitignore).
3. A Swiftlint configuration file is provided for you. It is recommended for you to use Swiftlint and follow this configuration. Keep in mind that, ultimately, this tool is only a guideline; some exceptions may be made as long as code quality is not compromised.
4. Do not burn out. Have fun!

## Problem 1.1 Class Diagram (Simplified)

![class-diagram](https://i.imgur.com/7qfi9mo.png)


The architecture is mainly separated into four high level components. They are:

1. `PhysicEngine` contains physics related protocols which gives the game units physical properties.

2. `GameEngine` maintains the states of the game. It defines basic operations that manipulate the game state. It is modelled as a [Facade](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/facade) to encapsulate the complexity, therefore makes it easier for client to define game logic. It also makes use of the [Delegation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern) to delegates game logic to other classes. The `GameEngine` is unaware of the views but keeping track of `GameBubble` and `GameProjectile` virtually.

3. `GameRenderer` synchronize with device refresh rate to update the `GameEngine`, therefore creating a game loop.

4. `GameController` has two extensions under its scope, namely `BubbleGridRenderer` that handles bubble grid view on the display, and `GameLoop` that defines the game logic. All game logic can be found in `GameLoop` extension. I moved some overriding functions from the base class here, such as `touchBegan()` because the game logic also relies on touch input from users. This is to ensure that the extension responsibility is cohesive.

### Creating `GameBubble` and `GameProjectile` declaratively

The basic concept here is to break down and regroup each GameUnit's properties & behaviour as reusuable component. We can then assign these components to game units using different combination of the components at hand.

This is hard by traditional OOP because multiple inheritance is not allowed. By leveraging Swift's `protocol` & `extension`, we can provide default implementation to the protocol we defined. Moreover, we can set conditions such that only classes that inherits from `GameObject` will be able to access default implementation, otherwise the client will have to provide custom concrete implementation.

The benefits of such design is that we will have similar to declarative syntax in our `GameBubble` and `GameProjectile` class, for example:

```swift
class GameBubble: GameObject, Hexagonal, CollidableCircle {...}
class GameProjectile: GameObject, Geometrical, CollidableCircle {...}
```

As a consequence of using default implementation, the client does not need to provide any overriding functions in higher level at all, which makes the base class code base cleaner.

Each individual components also conforms to Open/Closed Principle whenever new GameUnits are introduced to future change.

## Problem 1.2 Extend design to support more complex game logic

As mentioned in one of the [PS3 Question](https://github.com/cs3217/2018-ps3-kfwong#problem-33), I'll be using [Strategy Pattern](http://www.oodesign.com/strategy-pattern.html) to define the `GameProjectile` behaviour. In short, `GameProjectile` will carry such strategy object (a.k.a algorithm encapsulated as object). `GameController` will then execute that strategy through an interface and update the view accordingly.

![projectile-strategy-pattern](https://i.imgur.com/J4zSuyt.png)

To answer the question with an example, `GameProjectile` will carry a `WildCardProjectileStrategy` that conforms to the `ProjectileStrategy` protocol. Upon reaching the game state, `GameController` execute the strategy through the interface defined by `ProjectileStrategy` (without knowing underlying algorithm). This will remove all the bubble of same color. `GameController` then update the view against the `GameEngine`'s result.

## Problem 2.1 Handling user input for angle

### Angle

The angle between two points along a horizontal x-axis can be computed using Pythagoras Theorem:

![angle](https://i.imgur.com/aXeCvUu.png)

The formula is
```swift
x-component = projectile.x - touchpoint.x
y-component = projectile.y - touchpoint.y

angle-Î¸ = arctan(y-component / x-component)
```

### Firing Movement Upwards

Given the angle, we can use vector equation to simulate movement:

```swift
moveX -= thrust * cos(angle)
moveY -= thrust * sin(angle)
```

The projectile will update the x-y coordinates as the renderer update the `GameEngine`. We can also programmatically restrict the angle the user can fire the projectile.

As a bonus, reflecting off side walls is simply negate the x-component.

## Problem 3: Testing

I've integrated the Level Designer from PS3 to assist with black box testing. Tester can create any level design to start their testing against a specific level easily. You can use the save/load function to switch between different levels for testing.

#### Important notes
The minimal level designer is for testing only, so tester should **always design the level such that all bubbles are connected to the top row**. Otherwise, the level will start with dangling bubbles, but detach after the projectile is fired for the first time. This will be fixed in PS5 production.

### Testing on Empty Canvas
#### Firing movement

### Whitebox Testing

#### `PhysicsEngine`
All default implementation can be unit tested.

`Collidable Circle` 
- check if `isCollidingWith()` is true/false given a hardcoded coordinates overlapping/non-overlapping circle
- check if `isCollidingWithScreenSideEdge()` is true/false given a hardcoded coordinates that is outside/inside of left/right screen.
- check if `isCollidingWithScreenTopEdge()` is true/false given a hardcoded coordinates that is outside/inside of top screen

`Hexagonal`
- check if `neighbourIndexes()` return indexes indicated by the offset vectors (including negative and positive discrete indexes)

`Geometrical`
- check if `verticalAngleFromSelf()` return angle in radian for any positive or negative values.

#### `GameEngine`
`GameBubble` should test together with `GameProjectile` to check if it receives update from observer pattern.

`GameProjectile`
- check if `fire()` create movement for projectile with respect to the angle and thrust value.
- check if `normalizedBearing()` calculates restricted min/max angle correctly.
- check if `snapToPoint()` move the projectile to the specified point.

#### Game Logic
Prepopulate `GameEngine` with a virtual state using `addActiveGameBubble()` method.

- check if `getActiveNeighours()` return list of `GameBubble` that are currently in game.
- check if `neighbourIndexes()` return list of valid neighbour indexes given a `GameBubble`. Negative values and out of bounds indexes should not be in the list.
- check if `getConnectedGameBubbles()` given any active `GameBubble`. It should return a list of `GameBubbles` that connect to the source.
- check if `getDisconnectedGameBubbles()` return list of `GameBubble` that are disconnected from top row.

#### GameRenderer
- check if the `start()` method synchronize with device refresh rate and create a game loop. The delegate pattern method `onGameLoopUpdate()` should be tested together.

#### GameController
- check if `recoverLevelData()` repopulate the grid with list of `Bubble` models. The grid should be populated with respective colors and correct positions

## Footnotes

### Modelling `GameBubble` as hexagons

#### Odd-r Offset Coordinates 
![](https://i.imgur.com/9n5Iowb.png)

`GameEngine` can determine the position of `GameBubble` by providing sections and items count.

#### Neighbour offset vectors
![](https://i.imgur.com/tmrI2SW.png)

Using these information, we can simply model the game using mathematical functions, including algorithms such as BFS. Although the `Graph` data structure can be more flexible for future extension, this is sufficient to cover the current problem set and is easier to work with.
